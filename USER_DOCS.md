# CAESER_CIPHER_JS USER Documentation

If you have not yet read the 'Getting Started' section of the [README](../README.md), please do so before continuing.

## Getting Started

 - Once you have installed Caesar-Cipher-Js, import it using the following command:
  ```js
  import { Cipher } from "caeser-cipher-js"; 
  ```
 - To use the Cipher functions you can call 'encrypt' or 'decrypt'.
    ``` js
    const textToEncrypt = "This message will be encrypted.";
    const shift = 4;
    const message = Cipher.encrypt(textToEncrypt, shift);
    // OUTPUT: XLMW QIWWEKI AMPP FI IRGVCTXIH.
    ```
   - The value of the message variable is encrypted with a shift 4 key.
  
 - To decrypt, pass in the decrypted message and the reverse-shift.
    ``` js
    const message = Cipher.decrypt("XLMW QIWWEKI AMPP FI IRGVCTXIH.", -4); 
    // OUTPUT: THIS MESSAGE WILL BE ENCRYPTED
    ```

 - Alternatively, you can install only the modules that you need.
   ```js
   import { encrypt } from 'caeser-cipher-js'
   
   const password = encrypt('myPasswordHere', -6);
   ```

### Multi-Shift Keys
 - You can also pass a multi-shift key for a more secure encryption.
 - NOTE: numbers in a multi-shift key must be separated by commas to work.
   ```js
   console.log(encrypt("Don't Forget To Make Sure The Passwords are encrypted!", '3,8,9'));
   // OUTPUT: GWW'W NXUONW BX PITH ADUM CKM YDABZWAGA JUM NQKABXCHL!

   // Knowing the multi-shift key, pass in the opposite sign used in the encryption.
   console.log(decrypt("GWW'W NXUONW BX PITH ADUM CKM YDABZWAGA JUM NQKABXCHL!", '-3,-8,-9'));
   // OUTPUT: Don't Forget To Make Sure The Passwords are encrypted!
   ```

### Brute Force Attack(decryption)
  - For single shifts, you can use a 'brute-force' attack if you don't know the shift number.
  - Knowing this, you can tell why it is much more secure to encrypt a message using multiple shifts.
    ```js
      console.log(decrypt("RD XJHZWJ RJXXFLJ", 'BRUTE FORCE'));
      // This will output all possible combinations from shift 0-25.
    ```

## Emailing Data 

  Install the global Module first.

    import { Cipher } from "caeser-cipher-js";

  - Caeser-Cipher-JS offers six methods that allow email sending.
    - sendEncryptionMessage(sender, recipient, data)    // Emails recipient only the encrypted message
    - sendEncryptionKeys(sender, recipient, data)       // Emails recipient only the shift/shifts used and number indexes if present
    - sendEncryptionAll(sender, recipient, data)        // Emails recipient all data
    - sendDecryptionMessage(sender, recipient, data)    // Emails recipient only the decrypted message
    - sendDecryptionKeys(sender, recipient, data)       // Emails recipient only the shift/shifts used
    - sendDecryptionAll(sender, recipient, data)        // Emails recipient all data

  All 6 of these methods return true if the email was successful. False, if otherwise.

  - If interested in using the email functions, there are additional set-up instructions for you to follow.
  - Make sure to run ``` npm install ``` to install all dependencies.
  - Follow [This Article](https://dev.to/chandrapantachhetri/sending-emails-securely-using-node-js-nodemailer-smtp-gmail-and-oauth2-g3a) to set up an Gmail OAuth2 App.
    - Follow steps 1-3 carefully. You will set up your OAuth Credentials using the Gmail API. 
    - Make sure sure save the credentials in a safe place for later. You will need the CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, and REFRESH_TOKEN.
    - Do not do anything for step 4. All of this code work has been done for you. 
    - create a .env file in the project's root directory
    - Paste in this code in the .env file and substitue in the values with your gmail and OAuth2 info:  
        ```
        EMAIL=YOUR_GOOGLE_EMAIL_HERE
        REFRESH_TOKEN=PASTE_REFRESH_TOKEN_HERE
        CLIENT_SECRET=PASTE_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE
        CLIENT_ID=PASTE_CLIENT_ID_HERE   
        ```
    - Now you are able to send data to gmail accounts!
